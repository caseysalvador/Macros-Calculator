5'8" Height
206 lbs Bodyweight

Formula: Bodyweight x 14 through 16 (14 - 16 is a scale for fitness intensity)
So, 206 x 14 = 2884 cal (desk job, less fitness throughout the day)
So, 206 x 15 = 3090 cal (moderate fitness)
So, 206 x 16 = 3296 cal (active all day)

To maintain current weight must meet 2884 calories
we want to get shredded so subtract 500
therefore our target is now 2384 calories
if you would like to gain, add 500

Calories Per Gram
Protein = 4 calories per gram
Fat = 9 calories per gram
Carbohydrate = 4 calories per gram

Calculate Macros for Protein
Bodyweight x .75 - 1.25 grams per lb (g/lb)
206 x .75 - 1.25
.75 = 154.5g/lb     |        1 = 206g/lb          | 1.25 = 257.5g/lb
New to Training     |   In Shape 20% body fat     | Competing in Competition
So in my case, 206g/lb per day

Calculate Macros for Fat
Bodyweight x .3 - .4 grams
206 x .3 = 61.8g (Carbs are life)
206 x .35 = 72.1g ("Whatever")
206 x .4 = 82.4g (Love Fatty Foods, i.e. Nuts, Butters)
So in my case, 62g carbs per day (Carbs help with performance more than fats)

Calculate Macros for Carbohydrates
So Goal Calories is 2384cal
Look at Calories Per Gram to calculate Carbs
Protein: 206 x 4 = 824cal
Fat: 62 x 9 = 558cal
Add Protein Cal & Fat Cal: 824 + 558 = 1382cal
Subtract Goal Calories 2384 - 1382 = 1002cal So Carbs: 1002cal
Carbs: 1002cal / 4 =  250.5 So, 251g of Carbohydrates

Final Macros
P: 206g at 824cal
F: 62g at 558cal
C: 251g at 1002cal
Cal: 2384cal per day

Calculating your avg weight
Starting 206
Week 1 = 7days of weigh in and avg it out and so forth
When you notice you are slowly cutting avg weight start pulling away from Carbs about 15g or do more cardio
you can also bring down your fat as well for example 62g down to 58g - 50g
